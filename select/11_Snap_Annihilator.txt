Save me, save me
Take me, take me
To another place
I don't wanna see your face anymore

You try harder to annoy me
To creep under my skin
Slowly destroyin'
The end of me it begins
Something bulding up inside
A rage I've never known

God help me
Please Help me
I'm loosing control
Yeah!

Save me
Take me
To another place
I don't wanna see your face anymore

I just want it in a cold way
Hate shame and degrade me
I gotta get you out of my head
For the abuse that you gave me
I think I'd rather be dead... yeah
Something building up inside
I hope you'll never know

God help me
Please Help me
I'm loosing control
Yeah!!

Save me
Take me
To another place
I don't wanna see your face anymore ¡No!

Save me
Take me
To another place
I don't wanna see your face anymore ¡No!

SNAP... It's time to end the nightmare
And put you behind

Save me
Take me...
What a big disgrace
I don't wanna see your face anymore ¡No!

Save me
Take me
Take me to another place
I don't wanna see your face anymore ¡No!
