# Rosa Linn – SNAP

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
It's 4 AM
I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories
would fade, they never do
Turns out people lie
They say,
"Just snap your fingers"
As if it was really that easy
for me to get over you
I just need time
Snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
I'm writin' a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left?
I'm losing count
Since June 22nd
My heart's been on fire
I was spendin' my nights
in the rain, tryna put it out
So I'm snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
Oh-oh-oh-ohh
'Cause I might snap
Oh-oh-oh-ohh
And if one more person says,
"You should get over it"
Oh, I might stop talkin'
to people before I snap,
snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talkin'
to people before I snap
Snappin' one, two
Where are you?
(Where are you?)
You're still in my heart
(Still in my heart)
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
(Need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might sna-,
yeah, snap
(Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
'Cause I might sna-,
yeah, snap
(Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
Get out of my heart,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, heart
(Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
'Cause I might snap
(Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
Get out of my heart, yeah
'Cause I might snap
